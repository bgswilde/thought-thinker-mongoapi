## Installation

With no deployed front end, installing on your local machine is a must. Here's how to install:

    * In your command line, navigate to the desired location for this repo directory.
    * Use the command 'git clone' in your command line with the link of this repo to copy into your local machine.
    * Navigate into the newly cloned directory in your command line.
    * Run 'npm install' or 'npm i' in your command line while still in the root folder of this application to install dependencies required (express, mongoose)

## Usage
This application is a MongoDB NoSQL database and does not have a deployed front end to interact with this API. Here's what you can do if you would like to use this on your local machine or even connect it to a front end you may have:

    * Install using the installation instructions above.
    * Use an API endpoint testing application like Insomnia or Postman to interact with the endpoints in this database and perform CRUD operations on the data.
    * For the exact endpoint syntax, you can reference them in 2 places in the code:
        * In the "controllers" folder, see the comment above each CRUD operation in each controllers file for what the operation does and the endpoint.
        * In the routes/api folder, thought-routes and user-routes files also contain comments above each route for descriptions and enpoint details.
    * For Further details on the routes, view the walkthrough videos below
